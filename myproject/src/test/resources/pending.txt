	. When I drag the elements, the elements disappear from the origin and then appear in the destination.
	. I need to implement the CTRL button to stop selecting all the element when I leave the button CTRL and I press in the blank part
	  of the list or in any other element from the list.
	. Only I select several elements from the list if I have pressed the CTRL button.

	I need to implement this: $scope.delete = function() {
		. If I confirm delete, I call the rest server method delete to delete the projects and I reload the view calling @RequestMapping("/angular/projects") -> List<Project> getProjects(), so that all starts again
		. If I cancel the deletion I need to add the elements to delete to the list, namely add to  $scope.models[0].items maintaining its position, I need to save the position in the element project or use sth like @index to restore in the appropriare position
