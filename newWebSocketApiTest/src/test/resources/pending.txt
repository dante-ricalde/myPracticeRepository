2. To test if the server websocket endpoint is loaded by using the runtime monitoring if it is possible, if not by using a java client

This statement:

is bad, I need to put this statement (lines)
var myDomainWS2 = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/webSocketApiTest/anyUrlPattern/myDomainHandler"), replace localhost by local ip
 in the app lifted with domain 	http://mydomain.com to consume the web socket in /webSocketApiTest app in localhost.

 Improvements to make to chat:
 
 1.) When a user is disconnected, notify him that he is disconnected with a message, and when the user logs in again in the app he can received the pending messages which he couldn't 
 	receive while disconnected (using the heartbeats and trying to reconnect from the client if it's possible and if it's necessary try to log in automatically from the client showing a message
 	that the user has been reconnected).
 2.) Add the time and the user name to the message sent.
 3.) Show all the users but highlighting with a green colour button the users connected.
 4.) Add the acknowledgements to the messages sent with a single tick when the message has been successfully sent (use the receipts for this when sending the message), a double tick 
 	when the message has been delivered to the recipient, and a green double tick when the recipient has read your message.

 3/11 =>
 	I need to implement receipts in the client because sometimes the subscribe messages take a few time to be sent to the rabbit mq broker by the StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler and the send
 message is sent first before (I could solve it using a timeout of 10 seconds for example to send). The best solution is using receips in stomp js client.

	I need to implement the highlighted double tick to show that the recipient has read the message.
	Solution:
		- When the recipient receives the message besides sending the message indicating that is received by the client it's necessary to send a message indicating
		that the message has been read if the user window is open.
		When the user window passes from being closed to open it's necesary to send a message to the messages-message.sender-notification that the messages has been read
		so that the sender can mark all the messages that have not been marked as read as read.
