Splitter

	- test an splitter with a ref implementation returning a list of payload with a argument 
	  of Message type (put correlationId, sequence number)
	- test an splitter with a ref implementation returning a list of Message instance with a argument 
	  of payload type (put correlationId, sequence number, etc)
	- test an splitter without a ref implementation asuming that the message that arrived 
	  to the input-channel is an implementation of Collection and the default splitting logic
	  will be applied to the colecction incorporating each individual element into a Message
	  and sending it to the output-channel
	- Configure a splitter with annotations testing if the annotation may be applied in a method
	  that does not return  a Collection
	- Configure a splitter with annotations testing a method that returns collection 
	  with messages instances
	- Configure a splitter with annotations testing a method that returns collection 
	  without messages instances (payload instances)
