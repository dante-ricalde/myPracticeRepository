	Error Handling
1. to test a gateway where any error has ocurred downstream so that the error will be re-thrown as a Messaging Exception (RuntimeException) upon the Gateway's method invocation.
2. to test a gateway with a transformer (to create the expected error response objects and then the object created will then be the payload that is sent back to the caller) and
	an error-channel attribute.
3. to test a gateway where you want to completely suppress Exceptions using the global channel "nullChannel"
4. to test a gateway with a one-way flow where nothing would be sent back to the caller
